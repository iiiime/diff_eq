### Modeling analysis
Implementations of solving eqautions by Newton's method and solving differential equations by Euler's method. Basic algorithms for 
dynamical model simulations.

#### Introduction
We aim to have a better understanding of the dynamics in gene regulatory circuit using mathematical modeling 
and computational simulation. In this rotation project, the results from An excitable gene regulatory circuit induces
transient cellular differentiation (Suel, 2006) were reproduced.
